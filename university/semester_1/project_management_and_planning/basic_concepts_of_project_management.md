## General Course Objective 
To understand the most important concepts that contextualize the field of knowledge in project management and direction, and the reference frameworks that can be used.
Despite the fact that projects can be of completely different types and areas, they can share convergent structures and can rely on patterns to identify and propose activities related to their management. They are unique, generate a unique result and have a limited duration.

Reference frameworks are the guides generated by associations to create standards, but they can be adapted and managed to our project to be carried out in the best way.

The project may have limitations such as:
- Time (When should it be delivered)
- Resources (What do I have available)
- Scope (How much can I cover with the project)

Methodologies support us for the application of concepts in the project.

### The Discipline of Project Management and Direction

#### Definitions
- **Project**: It is a temporary effort carried out to create a unique product, service or result.
- **Project Management**: The application of knowledge, skills and techniques to carry out project activities and thus meet its objectives.
- **Project Planning**: crucial phase where objectives are established, necessary tasks and resources are determined, the schedule is defined and risks and opportunities are identified.
- Project management methodologies: There are various methodologies and approaches to project management, such as PMI (Project Management Institute), PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments) and agile approaches such as Scrum and Kanban. It is important to understand the differences and similarities between these methodologies to choose the most appropriate one for your project.
- Project planning process:
	
	a. Definition of objectives: Identify the project objectives and ensure that they are clear, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-limited (SMART).
	
	b. Identification of stakeholders: Identify the people, groups or organizations that may affect or be affected by the project and establish communication and collaboration strategies with them.
	
	c. Scope definition: Establish the project limits, describing what is included and what is not.
	
	d. Development of a work plan: Create a work plan that details all the tasks necessary to complete the project, assigning responsibilities and resources.
	
	e. Estimation of time and resources: Estimate the time and resources needed to complete each task, and create a project schedule.
	
	f. Risk identification and evaluation: Identify the risks and opportunities that may affect the project and evaluate their probability and impact. Develop mitigation and response strategies for identified risks.
	
	g. Creation of a communication plan: Develop a communication plan to ensure an effective flow of information between team members and stakeholders.
	
- Monitoring and control: During project execution, it is crucial to monitor and control project progress, comparing actual results with objectives and adjusting the plan as necessary.
	
- Project closure: Upon project completion, conduct a final review to ensure that all objectives have been met and that all deliverables have been delivered. Conduct a project evaluation to identify lessons learned and best practices for future projects.
