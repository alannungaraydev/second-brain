Is a Javascript library to create interfaces


It's a library less opinionated architecture
community driven 
focused on best practices

The components can communicate with others with props 
the event bubbling is disabled so the data 
The component state is a vio linked to a state

the react application acts as state machine
the state. is immutable
html vs jsx
